# zero-dollar-cryptocard
The ZeroDollar is a “currency” that is based on a valueless unit-system, just like in the movies. The ZeroDollar Cryptocard itself is a mix from Global Unconditional Basic Income, Redistribution of Profits (not wealth), a Resource-Based Economy starter, and evolves into the system in waves… It also forces the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by focusing on the long-term sustainable management of resources and the resulting waste (Circular Economy), and the fair and transparent resource distribution to 100% of the world's population, no matter what.
