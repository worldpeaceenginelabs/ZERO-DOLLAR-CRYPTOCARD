# ZERO DOLLAR CRYPTOCARD https://zerodollar.app

### The ZeroDollar is a “currency” that is based on a valueless unit-system, just like in the movies.

### The ZeroDollar Cryptocard itself is a mix from Global Unconditional Basic Income, Redistribution of Profits (not wealth), a Resource-Based Economy starter, and evolves into the system in waves…

### It also forces the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by focusing on the long-term sustainable management of resources and the resulting waste (Circular Economy), and the fair and transparent resource distribution to 100% of the world's population, no matter what.
<br><br><br>

# The app

### For starters, we get the ball rolling and start with Sustainable Development Goal #2

### Get yourself three meals a day, no matter what.

### ZeroDollar.app will connect you with your local food waste economy.

### Every meal costs 1 ZD.

### You will get 3 ZD each day for free.

# Behind the scenes (Minimum viable product)

### To get the ball rolling fast, because real people in the real world are hungry, we drop crypto and complicated workflows for now.

- Version 1 stable is a foodsharing app clone, which private and corporate supporters are able to post food donations on a map.
- Every user gets 3 pickups in a 24 h period (which equals three ZeroDollar, but without the IT rat tail, just a limit to 3 each day)
- If the MVP runs well, we can start thinking about adding services, always sustainability and circularity in mind related to "how much of it in a defined period" (cloth? schoolbooks? furniture? carsharing rides? delivery jobs? public traffic rides? housing? cars? boats?)

# It needs just small steps as a group to reach the goals together...
