# ZERO DOLLAR CRYPTOCARD https://zerodollar.app

### The ZeroDollar is a “currency” that is based on a valueless unit-system, just like in the movies.

### The ZeroDollar Cryptocard itself is a mix from Global Unconditional Basic Income, Redistribution of Profits (not wealth), a Resource-Based Economy starter, and evolves into the system in waves…

### It also forces the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by focusing on the long-term sustainable management of resources and the resulting waste (Circular Economy), and the fair and transparent resource distribution to 100% of the world's population, no matter what.
<br><br><br>

# The app

### For starters, we get the ball rolling and start with Sustainable Development Goal #2

### Get yourself three meals a day, no matter what.

### ZeroDollar.app will connect you with your local food waste economy.

### Every meal costs 1 ZD.

### You will get 3 ZD each day for free.

# Behind the scenes (Minimum viable product)

### To get the ball rolling fast, because real people in the real world are hungry, we drop crypto and complicated workflows for now.

- Version 1 stable is a foodsharing app clone(reduced to map, spots, picture and short description, no profile), which private and corporate supporters are able to post food donations on a map.
- Every user gets 3 pickups in a 24 h period (which equals three ZeroDollar, but without the IT rat tail, just a limit to 3 each day)
- If the MVP runs well, we can start thinking about adding services, always sustainability and circularity in mind related to "how much of it in a defined period" (cloth? schoolbooks? furniture? carsharing rides? delivery jobs? public traffic rides? housing? cars? boats?)

# Clone the foodsharing app

This map shows where to pick up free food.
The orange spots are permanent voluntary pick up spots, having fresh food every day, saved from wasting (institutions, non-profits, community colleges, businesses, and even on bicycles)

This is a private person offering multiple things. You could either pick some or get all of it.

This is a german project which interacts with the app.
There are bicycles with a box on the back locked in all areas in Cologne for instance.
People are able to drop and pick groceries, they would the other way throw away.
There is a bepictured instruction, how to clean the boxes, and people doing it on a weekly basis voluntarily.

# It needs just small steps as a group to reach the goals together...
